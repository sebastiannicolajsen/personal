My name is Sebastian, I'm currently studying a Ph.D. in Computer Science, more specifically on the topic of computing education. I made this small travel log to track my future endeavours abroad which starts August 2024. Hopefully I will find the time to combine my interests in photography with the many travels which lie ahead.

Specifically, I am embarking on an adventure to the U.S. where I'm going to be attending U.C. Berkeley as a visiting student researcher under [Dan Garcia](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/garcia.html) as part of the [Algorithms and Computing for Education (ACE) lab](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/). Back home, I am enrolled in my Ph.D. programme at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/) as part of the Center for [Computing Education Research](https://ccer.itu.dk/) with my three supervisors [Claus](https://www.itu.dk/people/brabrand/), [Marisa](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/marisa-cohn), and [Samantha](https://anthropology.ku.dk/staff/assistant-professor-and-postdoc/?pure=en/persons/644380).

While much of my journey is academic, I will here share the ups and downs mostly as a personal log, but also for the entertainment of family and friends.

## Grants

It is crucial to mention that this stay wouldn't be feasible without the amazing support from various financial actors, namely:

- [Fulbright Denmark](https://fulbrightcenter.dk).
- [Stibo fonden](https://www.stibofonden.dk).
- [The PhD School at the IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme).

Each grant has been a tremendous support in allowing me to first and foremost *go* abroad, but secondly conduct a study across the U.S. For any Danes considering a stay during their degree whether it be master's or Ph.D. I highly recommend the two external grants (Fulbright and Stibo). In particular, if you are going to the U.S., you should be applying for the Fulbright grant which has been a tremendous support already beyond the financial attributes.


## For the gear heads

As stated, I'm a bit into photography and, in particular, the associated gear. So, what travel log would be completed without an outline of my trusty gear. Currently, I am using a used [Sony A7iii](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7m3-b) in combination with the beautiful [Voigtl√§nder 40mm f/1.2](https://www.voigtlaender.de/lenses/e-mount/40mm-11-2-nokton-aspherical/?lang=en), and, a quite quirky little fellar, a 30mm disposable camera lens by [ICONXDesign on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/dk-en/listing/1649901113/disposable-camera-lens-for-sony-e-mount?click_key=207ea6a32c457c5fdc93d0afc263e17b0b2a931c%3A1649901113&click_sum=5aa725ab&ref=shop_home_feat_1). Had I employed my education properly, I would have printed it myself... after all, I did take a course in 3D printing called '*How to make almost anything*'...
