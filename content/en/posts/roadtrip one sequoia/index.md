On the second day of our road trip, we decided to sleep in a bit and got up and out around 8. From here, we restocked on provisions (and a sandwich for the road) and drove 2 hours to reach our first stop in Sequoia. Arriving at around 10, we took on the first trail of the day, namely, Tokopah Falls. We learned from yesterday, that we definitely needed less hike as we would be out during the warmest hours of the day. Therefore, we settled for Tokopah Falls as our first trail (roughly 6 kilometers, with an elevation gain of 200m).

It was a beautiful walk, easy to climb, and while the fall was running with little water due to the season (and no melting water from the mountains) it was quite beautiful. Compared to Yosemite, the hike itself slightly resembled the top of Nevada Falls. Again, people were enjoying the cold spring water (bathing and enjoying the sun). We even got to experience the loss of a Gatorade which bopped along the waterfall…

Prior to doing the Tokopah Falls trail, we had decided to walk less this day, and instead drive to the different scenes and do smaller walks to experience the more diverse sides of the park. Thus, we set for the General Sherman Tree only a short distance from Tokopah Falls. While the tree was impressive, many of the trees in the area were almost as impressive as this specific tree (which allegedly is the second largest in the world). Sadly, we didn’t get to do the longer trail here, as we had to keep moving if we were to make it to Monterey in time for check-in at our next hotel.

Therefore, we hastily drove to our next stop, the Big Trees Trail almost next to General Sherman Tree. To us, this short (and very accessible trail) was more impressive than the Sherman Tree, with the huge sequoias standing at the edge of the open meadow. Walking around and seeing these massive trees were truly impressive when their surroundings dwarfed in comparison.

At last, we decided to go to the Moro Rock trail. We were very dubious about this route, as the General Sherman Tree on various online platforms had been rated more impressive than the other hikes (Tokopah Trails, Big Trees Trail, and Moro Rock). However, after reaching the Big Trees trail, our trust in these online ratings was skeptical, to say the least; it was truly beautiful. Reaching Moro Rock completely destroyed our trust in the online ratings – it was spectacular. Sitting at a height of roughly 2 kilometers, reaching the top of the dome allowed us to overlook the mountain ranges in a 360-degree open view. Albeit I am seldom frightened by heights, the wind and small passages here (despite some kind of rail) got to me. It was beautiful, but not for the faint of hearts.

Following this amazing final short trail, we got in the car and drove to our next destination. While there is not much to say about this 5-hour drive, it was impressive to get to drive through 80 kilometers of straight road through various wheat fields. That’s not something you get to experience every day. Thus, we concluded our second day again around 23, driving roughly 7 hours, and covering roughly 530 kilometers.
