The last day of our road trip was again reduced in terms of walking and instead more driving. First, we enjoyed the day in Monterey, driving to the beach and seeing the old Fisherman’s Wharf. While we were kind of overwhelmed with the touristy feel of the one in San Francisco, this one was a bit more authentic and less filled with tourist attractions – a nice welcome!

Following our morning we had some coffee and Thomas got the largest salad we have seen since we arrived.  Following this, we drove down to Big Sur and stopped near the infamous bridge (which is straight out of a James Bond movie) and later on a nearby beach.

Generally, this trip took less time than expected and we drove towards home early in the afternoon. On our way, we stopped to get some food. While not mentioned in the other posts, we have not only been exploring national parks but also American cuisine. It is no secret that our stomachs have had to adjust to the food over here. Chipotle was a welcoming change as our bodies seemed to appreciate it more – generally more greens and less cheese and cream. However, we wouldn’t have been without the experiences of Applebees, Olive Garden, and Subway!

Thus we concluded our day with a 2.5 hours drive back to Berkeley, resulting in a daily drive of roughly 280 kilometers.
