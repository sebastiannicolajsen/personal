On the 14th, after our last roadtrip we drove to the airport early morning to return our rental car, and fly to Maui as the last vacation time before starting work. We arrived around 11 local time, and drove to our hotel in Kihei. Here, we enjoyed the rest of the day on the beach and at the pool. We also got to experience how even supermarkets (like our local ABC store) had some amazing fish in ready-to-eat lunch-sized bowls – something which we definitely enjoyed for the rest of our time here.

The following day we spend the morning at the beach and the early afternoon at the pool. I also managed to get a bit sunburned (something which only got worse during our stay, despite the use of plenty SPF). Thus, we decided to walk to the nearby town of Wailea. Here we spend the rest of the night, enjoying a nice Polynesian dinner. Generally, the first two days were characterized by relaxation which was welcome after our intense three-day road trip. However, we weren’t going to do that for the rest of our stay, and on the third day, we picked up our rental car early in the morning (this time using the Turo app for the first time). This time we opted for an EV as it was the closest car (more easily accessible), and the island seemed to be drivable on a single charge. We then drove towards the road to Hana, wanting to see the northeastern side of the island. On our way, we stopped for smoothies in the city of Paia.

From here, we drove many long twisted, and narrow roads through an extremely tropical coastal road on our way to Hana. Here, we stopped at the Twin Falls trail and made our way to the waterfall.

It was extremely different from the climate we experienced near our hotel, and we also got to experience rain. On our way to Hana, we also stopped at various locations to take in the beautiful view from smaller trails.

When we reached Hana, we tried continuing but realized the path ahead was closed (thanks to a local), and, that we would have to return the same way we came. Thus, we turned around the car, and drove back towards home, but managed to stop at a couple of beaches along the way, in particular, we hiked to the Red Sand Beach of Kaihalulu.

It was a short but beautiful hike across the rocky edges of the beach, into a small lagune with red sand. We had the place to ourselves but decided against swimming due to the currents and large waves. We therefore headed back towards Kihei, contemplating if we could manage to reach the summit of Haleakala (the large volcano on the island). Sadly, we had to save the summit of the volcano for the day after.

Originally, we intended to see the sunrise at the summit of the Haleakala volcano, but, couldn’t get our hands on a reservation for entering the park at this point in time (There’s a very limited number of reservations which are required to enter the park before 7). So, based on the recommendations of others, we decided to enjoy the beginning of the day at the pool and drive quite early to reach the summit before sunset (roughly around 19). However, being new to electric cars, we were surprised to see that our car would be depleted to only 20% battery once we’d reached the top. Unaware of how they work, we we’re afraid we wouldn’t be able to make it back down and out to the nearest charging station despite charging it all morning. After a bit of research, we figured out that it would recharge on our way down due to its regenerative charging. A bit skeptical, we proceeded to climb the mountain. Thankfully, we did so, as the sunset was nothing short of amazing up above the clouds at 3 kilometers, and naturally, the regenerative charging kicked in on our way down, and we got back to Kihei without any issues.

We therefore managed to return the car in time, and the following day (being our last) we enjoyed the pool and had an amazing dinner at a restaurant in Wailea. All in all, an amazing island with a wonderfully diverse climate that I can’t wait to get back to at some point in time.
