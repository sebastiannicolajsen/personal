On the 21st I had my first day at the University. Starting with lunch with the teaching faculty in the electrical engineering and computer science department, and a lovely tour of campus with my supervisor. I got a desk in the Hearst Memorial Mining Building, and have begun preparing for the coming semester. Already now, there seems to be a lot to do in the coming months – plenty of courses to sit in on, multiple interesting talks and workshops, and some great new colleagues.  While there isn’t much to write about academically yet, there is much to come!

When it comes to campus (see the pictures below) it is a completely different feel than what I am used to back home. The IT University of Copenhagen hosts a little less than 3000 students (including part-time students). U.C. Berkeley on the other hand boasts more than 48000 students. Different from similar universities back home (University of Copenhagen), U.C. Berkeley is mostly situated on the same campus with countless beautiful old and new buildings, small forest-like areas, and university busses driving around the rather large campus. I can’t wait to explore more of the different buildings, small areas for studying, and just the area as a whole. For now, it has also been my go-to running place, to get to see more of campus. Further, with the new undergraduates arriving in the last weeks, there has been a growth of life around the small Campus city – people gathering in the streets, in the restaurants, and attending the weekly taco Tuesdays.
