On the 11th we set sail for a short three-day road trip we planned prior to getting to the US.
Specifically, we had planned to see Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, and end the trip with a good night’s sleep in Monterey and driving through the Big Sur route before heading home to Berkeley.

We got up early in the morning and drove towards Yosemite. Along the way, we got to see quite a lot of different types of climate which we aren’t used to back home. As we knew nothing about Yosemite, we had no idea of what to expect, how much we would be able to see, or what it generally is like being in these national parks. We had gotten plenty of suggestions and advice for doing so, yet it was a first for all of us. As everyone had warned us, getting to the park is one thing, but it does take some time driving inside the actual park to get somewhere (in our case 1.5 hours more to Curry Village where we parked). On the way down, we got to see plenty of beautiful sights, stopping occasionally to take in the view.

From here, we sort of had an idea of what hikes we wanted to do, but no real reference to what each hike would require. Thus, we simply began walking toward our first destination, following a couple of detours along the way, but soon enough reached Mirror Lake.

From here, we decided to try and reach Nevada falls, but, again, we didn’t really have any idea of the hike. Turns out, it was quite a long hike which would be fine, if not for our lack of enough water and the rough heat as we ascended mid-day. However, along the way (following the Mist trail) we saw the beautiful rainbows (plural) happening at the foot of Vernal Falls.

Continuing from here, the last (and toughest part) of the trail followed. Climbing up to 1828m (from 1219m at the foot of the trail) we reached the beautiful overlook of Nevada Falls.

While the trip was beautiful, we should probably just have settled for one of them (as we ended up walking roughly 21km that day), and, had we instead decided on just Nevada Falls, we would have been able to spend more time up there with the beautiful spring of the waterfall wherein people were enjoying the cold water. Further, Mirror lake was mostly dried up during this time of year (leaving less of a spectacular view). Now, we had to get down in time before it got dark, and, hopefully, manage to drive out of Yosemite before dark onwards to our next destination. We managed to do so and drove to Fresno where we were to sleep for the night before continuing to Sequoia. Here we got to enjoy a true American motel experience (yes, it could have been the Bates Motel…). Thus, we ended the first long day at around 23, after getting up at 4 and driving roughly 440 kilometers and 7 hours.
