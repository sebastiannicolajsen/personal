Before Aisha had to travel home, we decided to spend the weekend in San Francisco. We’d already seen bits and pieces of the city (see [here]({{< ref "posts/going-abroad" >}})) when arriving. However, we figured it would allow us to explore the city in a different way – primarily by foot.  After checking in at our hotel, we went out to explore Chinatown. Chinatown is the largest outside of Asia, and, the oldest one in North America. Here, we got to enjoy some dumplings for a late lunch.

After visiting Chinatown, we walked to the Salesforce Park, being an interesting type of architecture; a park standing 4 stories above the road – accessible by gondola! It appeared to be a gathering place for everyone local, and was quite the different ‘park’ experience. Albeit being so young, it stands with fully grown trees and plant life as everything was planted not as saplings, but instead fully grown trees (which had to be transported up there…). This was more or less our first day in San Francisco, and the evening concluded with drinks at a local rooftop bar.

The day after we decided to take a slow morning, ordering bagels and staying in bed until it stopped raining. Then, we walked to see Japan town and the Golden Gate Park. While we didn’t get to see the Japanese tea house (due to an excessively long queue) we did experience a Christian band playing at the Music Concourse. From hereafter, we walked a different route back to the hotel, and simply enjoyed our last evening together by getting some pizza and watching tv! Afterall, we got up super early the morning after, to take the bus to the airport.
