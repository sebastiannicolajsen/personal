The 7th marked our leave from Denmark. However, lots of preparation has gone into getting here. I actually believe the idea of going to the U.S. started more than a year ago, a couple of weeks after I began my Ph.D. on January 1st 2023. However, the initial funding which made me and my supervisor dream of potential destinations didn't succeed.



All of a sudden I found myself without a plan, but with an agreement to stay at U.C. Berkeley for 5 months. Thanks to the help of Peter Sestoft, I found a plethora of other financial opportunities which would later turn out to make the stay possible.
