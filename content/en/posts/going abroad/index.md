On the 7th of August we traveled to the US as part of my journey to spend the next half year at U.C. Berkeley. While we experienced various nuisances in the form of a hurricane threatening our departure (Debby...) we managed to get to San Francisco albeit a bit later than expected. We picked up our car and drove to Berkeley where Thomas (one of the roommates) had found an amazing apartment overlooking the bay with only a short (but hilly) walk to campus.

Getting here took some time (beyond the delayed flights). Already when starting my PhD I promptly started discussing where to go abroad with my supervisor (mostly due to a scholarship application due two months after start). While I didn’t receive the particular grant, I ended up with an agreement with [Dan Garcia]( https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/garcia.html) at U.C. Berkeley but no money to get there. It’s no secret that California is way more expensive than back home, and so I found myself in a lack of funding for my stay. Thankfully, through the help of various colleagues, I managed to find a couple of different grants that would make the stay possible. Through the next year, I acquired the necessary funding from Stibofonden, Fulbright Denmark, and my home university. It all culminated with a reception at the American Embassy’s private residence meeting all the other Fulbrighters for the coming term – an amazing experience for sure, but compared to what others are doing out in the big wide world, ones own research fades in comparison. I am certain that the majority of those Fulbrighters I met will do great things in the future.

Location-wise Berkeley seems amazing, and equally so does San Francisco. While waiting for the last roomie to fly in, we spent the next couple of days enjoying the freedom of our rental car, and drove around the local area. A primary goal of us was to see the Golden Gate Bridge, however, due to the foggy conditions we tried multiple days. First, we got to see the black sand beach located just across the bridge, driving from Richmond seeing another side of the near area, and driving over the actual bridge. Sadly, it remained foggy.

We then picked the last roomie (Victor) up from the airport and went to see the Palace of Fine Arts and a couple of other things along the way. One of those things being our beloved supermarket, Berkeley Bowl. Generally, supermarkets are distanced from each other in a whole other way than we are used to from back home, and while more expensive, some of the groceries have been the best we’ve ever had – the avocados here are amazing.

At last, during our arriving days, we got to experience true American hospitality as our lovely landlord invited us upstairs for a small get-together between friends. The amount of suggestions and aid in regard to future adventures we received during those two hours was nothing short of amazing. Generally, Californian residents seem nothing short of amazing – both similar, but also different from the people we meet back home.
