      <description>The 7th marked our leave from Denmark. However, lots of preparation has gone into getting here. I actually believe the idea of going to the U.S. started more than a year ago, a couple of weeks after I began my Ph.D. on January 1st 2023. However, the initial funding which made me and my supervisor dream of potential destinations didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed.&#xA;All of a sudden I found myself without a plan, but with an agreement to stay at U.</description>

      <description>My name is Sebastian, I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying a Ph.D. in Computer Science, more specifically on the topic of computing education. I made this small travel log to track my future endeavours abroad which starts August 2024. Hopefully I will find the time to combine my interests in photography with the many travels which lie ahead.&#xA;Specifically, I am embarking on an adventure to the U.S. where I&amp;rsquo;m going to be attending U.</description>
